    "RFM model analyses customer behavior using three dimensions\n",
    "  1. Recency (R): How recent customer has made a purchase\n",
    "  2. Frequency (F): How often customer makes a purchase/subscribe within a time period\n",
    "  3. Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends within a time period\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of the model (The why?)\n",
    "RFM model is an importat tool which can aid BaridiBaridi to underpin the behavior of her customers, which can be an intelligible way of serving groups of customer, improved customer satisfication and productivity by the CS team.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use the model to create another Customer LTV model (Customer Lifetime Value), to predict future behavior of the customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within the Baridi Baridi database, We've transactions table as a sources from which we can havest the necessary to construct the RFM - Model."
